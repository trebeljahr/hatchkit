/*
 * Project manifest — .hatchkit.json at the root of a scaffolded project.
 *
 * Purpose: capture just enough about how this project was scaffolded
 * that `hatchkit update` can diff the current feature set against a
 * desired new one and apply only the delta.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * SECURITY: WHAT GOES IN — AND WHAT ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT
 * ============================================================
 *
 * The manifest file gets committed to the project's git repo. Treat
 * every field as eventually public. The included fields below are all
 * already public in one way or another (package.json `name`, the
 * domain is in DNS + .env.example, feature flags are inferable from
 * dependency lists, ports are in .env.* and docker-compose.yml).
 *
 * Fields that MUST NEVER be written here:
 *   - tokens, passwords, API keys (any credential)
 *   - serverId / serverUuid / serverIp / serverIpv4 / serverIpv6
 *     (Coolify server coordinates)
 *   - s3ExistingAccessKey / SecretKey / Endpoint / Bucket  (user creds)
 *   - serverSize / serverLocation (infrastructure cost signal)
 *
 * ProjectConfig has those fields; the `toManifest` function below is
 * the single choke point that picks out the safe subset. Any time a
 * new field is added to ProjectConfig, it must be triaged here — the
 * default is to NOT include it.
